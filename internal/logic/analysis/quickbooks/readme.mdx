# UniBee Integration with QuickBooks

When you enable QuickBooks integration within UniBee, we will synchronize your billing records from UniBee into your QuickBooks account. Since UniBee has already completed the **payment and tax processes**, QuickBooks acts purely as an **accounting record system**, not a payment processor or tax calculator.

## 📌 Why We Use the Invoice + Payment Model

We adopt the `Invoice + Payment` model instead of `SalesReceipt` for the following reasons:

- ✅ **UniBee handles real payments** — QuickBooks should not duplicate them.
- ✅ **Taxes are calculated within UniBee**, avoiding tax mismatches.
- ✅ Using `Invoice` allows us to **control tax logic**, avoiding QuickBooks' auto-tax computation.
- ✅ It supports flexibility in updates, refunds, and linking payments.

## 🧾 How We Record Your Transactions

For each paid transaction, we will:

- Create an `Invoice` in QuickBooks with each item line marked as non-taxable (`TaxCodeRef=NON`).
- Add a separate line to represent the **total tax amount** collected.
- Set `GlobalTaxCalculation: NotApplicable` to **prevent automatic tax overrides**.
- Create a `Payment` entry linked to the `Invoice` to show it is paid.

This ensures:

- Amounts and taxes match UniBee exactly.
- QuickBooks serves only as an accurate ledger.
- Compatibility with future actions like refunds and reporting.

## 🌐 Note for US QuickBooks Accounts

For US-based QuickBooks accounts, **automatic tax calculation (AST)** is enabled by default. The approach described above is the **only safe and consistent integration** method. Otherwise, QuickBooks may:

- Auto-calculate tax based on customer address;
- Override your provided invoice totals;
- Lead to discrepancies between UniBee and QuickBooks.

## 🔐 What Happens During Authorization

When your customer authorizes UniBee to access QuickBooks, we:

- **Only access billing and accounting-related scopes**;
- **Do not handle or redirect your QuickBooks payment channels**;
- **Do not modify your tax rules** — we only push static records;
- **Assign revenue and deposit accounts** to properly classify your data.

If you need to customize the mapping or account types, feel free to contact our support team.

## 🤝 Recommendations for a Smooth Integration

To ensure clean and accurate records:

- Avoid manually modifying invoices and payments pushed by UniBee;
- Perform all payment, refund, and invoice actions inside UniBee;
- If you operate in multiple regions with different taxes, please configure the correct Tax Codes in QuickBooks beforehand and sync them with UniBee.
